This game follows the Theme of "In the City" by rereating my hometown of ALgonquin with iconic landmarks like the Target, Walmart, hill, and my house. 
All textures were made by me in Photoshop. Asset of BB8 from the first in class Tutorial as well as code from player movement script, score manager, and target.
